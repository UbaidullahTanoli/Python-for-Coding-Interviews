To count the frequency / occurances of each element in a list, Pyhton gives us three methods, in the ascending order of simplicity:

Using a dictionay
Uisng defaultdict (from collections import defaultdict)
Using Counter (from collections import counter) and update

Let's use each of them on a simple example: List = [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4]

# Using a dictionary

mydict = {}
for i in List:
  if i in mydict:
    mydict[i] += 1
  else:
    mydict[i] = 1
return mydict 

# Using a defaultdict

We don't need to check if an element is present in our dictionary or List. 
  
from collections import defaultdict
mydict = defaultdict(int)
for i in List:
  mydict[i] += 1
return mydict
# Using Counter

Doesn't give error even if we write Counter[100]+=1 even though 100 isn't in the List
  
from collections import Counter
return Counter(List)

if we are counting the occurances in multiple Lists, we use update method

List1 = [1, 2, 3, 3]
List2 = [1, 2, 4]

count = Counter(List1)
count.update(List2)
  return count
